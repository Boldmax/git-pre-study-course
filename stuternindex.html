            <p>My name is Olabode and this is my story as a software development trainee...</p> 
            <p>I was familiar with using about 2 to 3 programming language, <strong>as a starter of course</strong>.
          <p>Learning, to me is not an option but a neccessity because my life expectation demand that I know as much as little about anything that I come across in life.</p>

            <p><strong>I started taking intro to programming using <i>free online resources and apps</i></strong>

            <p>There are two main online resources the I have used in my learning</p>

            <ol>

                <li>I also used an app I got from google play store for free (<strong>Sololearn</strong>) to learn the basic of <i>python</i>, <i>javascript</i> and <i>java</i> </li>
            </ol>
